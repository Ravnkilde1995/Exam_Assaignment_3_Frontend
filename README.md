# React Recap with token, login, logout and routing
The purpose of this repo is to recap the react topics we have learned so far. The repo is made for a workshop on 3rd semester of Datamatiker education at Cphbusiness.

The repo has 3 branches:
- main: The main branch is where we start from. It contains a basic react app with a login form and a logout button. The login form is connected to the backend server and the login button is connected to the backend server. The logout button is connected to the frontend only.
- final: The final branch is where we end up. after doing the work
- topnavigation: is a branch to show how the result could look like.

The backend server is the backend security server we have used in the previous exercises. The backend server is running on port 8080. This is set in the apiFacade.js file.
